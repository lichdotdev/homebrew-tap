# Rendered by .github/workflows/release.yml (0.83.0 -> tag, checksums from the
# release's checksums.txt) and pushed to the lichdotdev/homebrew-tap repository as
# Casks/lich.rb — edit this template, never the tap copy.
#
# A cask, not a formula: only a cask installs an .app into /Applications, which
# is what puts lich in Launchpad, in Spotlight and behind its own icon. The
# binary stanza keeps `lich` on PATH, so the one install still serves both.
